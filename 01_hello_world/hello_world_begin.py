# This is a comment! Any line starting with a # means Python will ignore it

"""
This is also a comment if you put triple quotes, you can add a big block of text!

Objective: create a variable called "message" before the print line and replace the "hello!" with your new variable.

The syntax is easy!

message = "YourTextGoesInHere"

Then, you can just replace everything in the parenthesis in the print line.
"""

print("hello!")
