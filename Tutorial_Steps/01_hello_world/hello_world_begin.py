"""
This is also a comment if you put triple quotes, you can add a big block of text!

Objective: create a variable called "message" before the print function line and replace the "hello!" with your new variable.

The syntax is easy!

message = "YourTextGoesInHere"

Then, you can just replace everything in the parenthesis in the print function line.

Additional info:

To start, we will learn two major parts of Python, variables and functions.

Variables are a place to store values, like a number, a character, or a string.
A function is a block of code that is called by calling its name followed by parenthesis, like print.
We're going to use Python's built-in functions for now and will talk about how to make your own in a future step.

# This is a comment! Any line starting with a # means Python will ignore it

print("hello!")
