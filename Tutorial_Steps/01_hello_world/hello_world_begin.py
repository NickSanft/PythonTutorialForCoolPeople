# This is a comment! Any line starting with a # means Python will ignore it.

"""
This is also a comment if you put two sets of triple quotes, you can add a big block of text!

Objective: create a variable called "message" before the print line and replace the "hello!" with your new variable.

The syntax is easy!

message = "YourTextGoesInHere"

Then, you can just replace everything in the parenthesis in the print function line.

Additional info:

To start, we will learn two major parts of Python, variables and functions.

Variables are a place to store values, like a number, a character, or a string.

A function is a block of code that is called by calling its name followed by parenthesis, like print.
In the parenthesis, you can pass different variables into it, which are called "arguments".
In this module, we're going to use the function print, in which we are going to pass in a string.
Python will then print whatever that is to our terminal when you click the green "run" button on the top right.

We're going to use Python's built-in functions for now and will talk about how to make your own in a future step.

print("hello!")
