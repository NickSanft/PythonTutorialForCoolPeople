"""
Objective: Print the local time on your computer using the time module

There are some built-in functions in Python like type() and print(), but what if we want to use something else?

This is where modules come in!

Some are already installed by default, like time, you can use it like the below.

time has a function called time_ns(), which returns the current time in nanoseconds.

This is the time for the most important lesson - Google to finish the objective.
If you can do that, you can do just about anything. I'm not even kidding.

import time

print(time.time_ns())
