# Python Tutorial for Cool People

Miss Fritters is currently a test of Llama3 using Ollama and Coqui TTS.

## Installation

- Create a GitHub account if you have not already [here.](https://github.com/signup)
- Download the latest version of Python [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download an IDE for Python. I highly recommend the Community Edition of PyCharm found [here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows)

For PyCharm:
- In PyCharm, click on the top left and choose "Project from version control"
- Choose "Repository URL"
- On the page for this repo in GitHub, click on "Code" and copy the URL to your clip board
- Paste it in and clone and you're ready to go!
- Test this out by right-clicking hello_world_begin

## How to follow the tutorial

- Each step to learn has files ending with _begin.py and _end.py
- Look at the "begin" file and try to accomplish the objective
- If you need a hint, you can look at the "end" file, but try not to!
